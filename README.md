### Sound Classification using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in ML.NET

#### Background
As of September 2019, it's possible to use transfer learning to natively re-train an InceptionV3 or Resnet CNN in ML.NET.
This enables .NET developers to be able to create their own image classification models for specific use cases.

However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) can be used in many other applications than just image classification.
In this repo we'll demonstrate how build a rudimentary sound classifier using ML.NET
